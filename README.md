# transduction

A.K.A. YAJTL, Yet Another JavaScript Transducer Library.

### Motivations:

* Implement transducers with a focus on *simplicity*.
* Focus on reasonably idiomatic JavaScript.
* Tool friendliness: rollup/webpack ready. Only pay for what you use.

### Not a concern

* Trying to reimplement Clojurisms like `seq`, `into`, etc. (Clojurescript exists).
* Trying to implement the Cognitect transducer protocol which is fine but chose different tradeoffs.
